## Regarding Current and Legacy Equipment Data
As of `August 31, 2019`, the `Japan` servers for `Princess Connect! Re:Dive` have different costs for equipment.<br>
***Some regions may not have updated to use these new costs.*** If your region still uses the old costs, use `Legacy Equipment Data` instead of `Current Equipment Data`

You can tell if your region uses `Legacy Equipment Data` by going to <https://expugn.github.io/priconne-quest-helper/pages/recipe-data/> and reviewing the recipes of some items.
For example:
- Justice God's Staff
  - LEGACY: `30` Fragments Required
  - CURRENT: `20` Fragments Required
- Lion Eagle's Feather
  - LEGACY: `5` Fragments Required
  - CURRENT: `3` Fragments Required

If your region's server uses `Legacy Equipment Data`, you can continue to use the `Legacy Equipment Data` by:
1) Go to the `Settings` page
2) Turn on "`Use Legacy Version`"

The `Recipe Data` and `Statistics` pages also have the ability to use the `Legacy Equipment Data` if desired.
